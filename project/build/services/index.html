        <h2>See around corners</h2>
        <p><strong>Threat modelling & preparation</strong> helps make sense of how adversaries might actually approach your systems and people. The focus is on attacker-centric models that map power structures and behaviours rather than abstract risk categories. It is a participatory process, often involving journaling, mapping, and shared documentation, to surface different perspectives and align understanding across a team. The result is not a static report but a working model that can be revisited, tested, and adapted as situations change.</p>
        <p><strong>Strategic foresight & scenario planning</strong> makes it possible to model emerging risks and disruptive technologies, develop multiple plausible futures, and test organisational assumptions. It embeds resilience by facilitating contingency frameworks and decision-making processes that are ready before disruption hits.</p>
        <p><strong>Threat modelling workshops</strong> offer hands-on, participatory modelling of adversary behaviour and operational risks. Teams co-create attacker-centric scenarios that lead to concrete defensive measures, while supporting learning, alignment, and cross-team collaboration.</p>

        <h2>Move together</h2>
        <p><strong>Facilitated choreographies</strong> are not linear roadmaps but looping, adaptive movements. As teams move through them, new risks, blind spots, or dependencies surface, and the steps shift accordingly—sometimes revisited, sometimes reshaped, sometimes abandoned. By combining scenario planning, backward mapping, and Satir-work-based retrospectives, organisations can anticipate challenges before they hit and adjust course in real time. Unlike conventional frameworks, these dances are face-to-face, with timelines that track human energy as well as milestones, and obstacle avoidance designed in from the start. Each choreography stands on its own, giving valuable insights even before they are combined.</p>
        <p><strong>Incident response & crisis facilitation</strong> covers everything from SIRT setup for small organisations to SOC advisory for larger ones. It includes tabletop exercises and live simulations to test response procedures, as well as crisis communication training and continuity planning.</p>
        <p><strong>Compliance & governance advisory</strong> provides practical guidance on GDPR, ISO 27001, and sector-specific security regulations. Governance workshops align organisational processes with real security practices, and gap analyses deliver actionable recommendations.</p>

        <h2>Learn by doing</h2>
        <p>Our training approach draws on Montessori’s hands-on experimentation and self-paced learning, Virginia Satir’s human-centric role-play and organisational development, and Gerald M. Weinberg’s principles of change and effectiveness management. Participants learn by doing, reflecting, and adapting, with exercises designed to develop insight, collaboration, and practical resilience.</p>
        <p>Within this framework, <strong>hands-on workshops</strong> offer several strands of capability building. <a href="https://green.tymyrddin.dev/docs/l-space/">Guerrilla Gardeners</a> focus on reclaiming and nurturing digital spaces with playful, practical exercises. <a href="https://red.tymyrddin.dev/docs/services/">Myrddin’s Menagerie</a> explores attacker behaviours and tradecraft, teaching teams to spot, move, and protect assets in a simulated wild environment. <a href="https://blue.tymyrddin.dev/docs/stormforge/">Stormforge</a> places crews in turbulent, storm-like conditions, building skills to patch, respond, and improvise under pressure. <a href="https://purple.tymyrddin.dev/docs/cross-training/">Cross-training & capability building</a> develops multi-skilled teams through rotations, gamified labs, and adversarial exercises, strengthening both individual competence and collaborative agility for purple teaming.</p>
        <p><strong>Security culture & awareness programmes</strong> embed security thinking into day-to-day operations at all levels, from executives to staff. Interactive workshops cover social engineering, phishing simulations, and human factors in security, with custom learning paths that match organisational maturity and roles.</p>

        <h2>Build to last</h2>
        <p><strong>Organisational risk audits & resilience assessments</strong> map organisational assets, dependencies, and critical processes. They identify weak points not just technically, but socially and procedurally, with actionable insights for mitigation, prioritisation, and monitoring.</p>
        <p><strong>Knowledge transfer & playbook development</strong> captures lessons learned from incidents or exercises and transforms them into practical resources. Outputs can include operational manuals, SIEM dashboards, detection playbooks, and SIRT/SOC workflows, tailored for onboarding and cross-team rotations.</p>
        <p><strong>Compliance & governance advisory</strong> also belongs here if the focus is on building practices that endure beyond a single audit cycle. The aim is to make compliance a by-product of doing security well, not a tick-box exercise.</p>
