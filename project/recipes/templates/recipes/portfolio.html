                <h2 id="Teaching">Teaching</h2>
                <p>The Montessori philosophy offers a holistic approach to education that recognizes the innate
                    potential and dignity of every individual. The autonomy, self-directed learning, and respect for
                    the individual are principles which have far-reaching implications beyond traditional educational
                    settings.</p>
                <p>Experiential Learning Theory, developed by David A. Kolb, is a widely recognized and influential
                    framework that describes how people learn through experience. People can use hands-on learning
                    processes for all forms of learning, development, and change.</p>
                <h3 id="Digital_defence_at_home">Digital defence @home</h3>
                <p>This project is about understanding the landscape and securing @home (and @smallorganisational)
                    contexts as good as we can ourselves. The approach is to pick the raisins out of the commercial
                    porridge. What makes sense in our respective contexts?</p>

                <p>Facilitation is the craft of guiding a group or individual through a participatory process that
                    makes it easier to achieve their goals. </p>
                <h3 id="Systems_thinking">Systems thinking</h3>
                <p>Systems thinking expands the range of choices available for solving a problem by broadening our
                    thinking and helping us phrase problems in new and other ways. The principles of systems thinking
                    can make us aware that there are no flawless solutions and that the choices we make will have an
                    impact on other parts of the system. By anticipating the impact of trade-offs, we can minimize
                    the impacts or even use them to our advantage. As a result, systems thinking allows us to make
                    better informed and less damaging choices.</p>
                <p>Systems thinking, in particular causal loop diagrams can be used to tell compelling stories
                    describing how a system works. </p>
                <h3 id="Retrospectives">Retrospectives</h3>
                <p>Retrospectives are popular in the team-working world of the Lean and Agile community. The
                    technique was inspired by the work of Virginia Satir. She developed a technique called
                    the Daily Temperature Reading for keeping relationships healthy and happy. Reflecting on what has
                    happened in the past (first the positive and then the negative) and then figuring out what to do
                    in the future to improve. And with a bit of creativity it can be made fun and enjoyable to do.</p>
                <h3 id="Looking_forward">Looking forward</h3>
                <p>Scenario planning originated in the U.S. military for making strategic decisions, to plan and
                    prepare for various possible futures. Today, scenario planning is used by all kinds of organisations
                    world-wide. Adding obliviousness and congruence awarenesses to scenario planning choreographies
                    make it a more balanced experience and suitable for planning deductive and inductive paths to
                    possible futures.</p>

                <h2 id="Dev">Software development</h2>
                <p>Software Development is the process of designing, creating, testing, and maintaining computer
                    programs and applications. </p>
                <h3 id="C_and_C++">C and C++</h3>
                <p>C and C++ are used for high performance and low-level control. It is suited for backend systems,
                    computationally intensive processes, and applications that require precise memory control.
                    Been there, done that in the stone age of computer science. At the moment not much to show,
                    but for some snippets. </p>
                <h3 id="Python">Python</h3>
                <p>Python is simple, versatile, and readable, and often used for web development, data analysis, and AI.
                    It is perfect for frontend scripts, prototyping, data manipulation, and creating user-friendly
                    APIs for C++-based backend systems.</p>
                <p>A lot of frameworks (25+) have been developed for Python, providing a structure for the code and
                    a set of tools and features that streamline the development process. Examples are Flask and FastAPI.
                </p>
                <h3 id="Python_frameworks">Python frameworks</h3>
                <p>Flask is a lightweight micro-framework used to quickly build simple web applications. It includes
                    support for Jinja templates (a way to reuse HTML code), request handling, and application
                    signaling.</p>
                <p>FastAPI’s only purpose is to build backend APIs. There must also be a frontend framework
                    to display the site to users. The framework is incredibly easy to work with, and it is even
                    possible to deploy an app with FastAPI through Kinsta and a GitHub repo in minutes.</p>
                <h3 id="ai">AI</h3>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is undoubtedly revolutionizing numerous fields, from healthcare and
                    finance to transportation and entertainment. Its potential to enhance efficiency, solve complex
                    problems, and drive innovation is enormous. So is its energy use. </p>
                <p>The rapid advancement and integration of AI into society also raises significant ethical, social,
                    and technical concerns that warrant critical examination.</p>
                <p>Exploring the various AI techniques can support such research.</p>

                <h3 id="threat_modelling">Threat modelling</h3>
                <p>Threat modeling is the process of using hypothetical scenarios, system diagrams, and testing to help
                    secure systems and data.</p>
                <p>Deanonymisation refers to the process of reversing the anonymisation of data, thereby revealing the
                    identity of individuals who were previously anonymous. This practice has significant implications
                    for privacy, security, and ethics, particularly in an era where vast amounts of data are collected,
                    shared, and analyzed. </p>
                <h3 id="Pentesting">Pentesting</h3>
                <p>A vulnerability assessment focuses on scanning hosts for vulnerabilities as individual entities.
                    Penetration
                    tests might start by scanning for vulnerabilities just as a regular vulnerability assessment but
                    pentesting
                    gives more information on how an attacker can <b>chain vulnerabilities</b> to achieve specific
                    goals.</p>
                <p>During pentesting, focus remains on identifying vulnerabilities and establishing measures to protect
                    the
                    network, but it also considers the network as a whole ecosystem and how an attacker could profit
                    from
                    interactions between its components.</p>
                <h3 id="Red_teaming">Red teaming</h3>
                <p>Red teaming is a term borrowed from the military. In military exercises, the red team simulates
                    attack
                    techniques to test the reaction capabilities of a defending blue team against known adversary
                    strategies.</p>

                <p>In cybersecurity, the <a href="https://red.tymyrddin.dev/">red team</a> emulates a real threat
                    actor's Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) for measuring how well the
                    <a href="https://blue.tymyrddin.dev/">blue team</a> responds and to test any
                    security controls in place. Usually the blue team is made up of members of a
                    <a href="https://purple.tymyrddin.dev/docs/soc/sirt">security incident response team (SIRT)</a>
                    and/or
                    <a href="https://purple.tymyrddin.dev/docs/soc/soc">security operations team (SOC)</a>, but in a
                    small
                    organisation can consist of the systems administrator with interested parties.</p>

                <p>Red teaming does not replace penetration testing. It complements it by focusing on detection and
                    response rather than prevention. Red teaming improves penetration testing by taking into account
                    more attack surfaces:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>Technical Infrastructure: Like in a regular penetration test, a red team will try to uncover
                        technical vulnerabilities, with a much higher emphasis on stealth and evasion.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Social Engineering: Targeting people through phishing campaigns, phone calls or social media
                        to
                        trick them into revealing information that should remain private.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Physical Intrusion: Using techniques like lockpicking, RFID cloning, exploiting weaknesses in
                        electronic access control devices to access restricted areas of facilities.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="Purple_teaming">Purple teaming</h3>
                <p>The scope and goals for <a href="https://purple.tymyrddin.dev/">purple team</a> operations are very
                    similar to the operations defined for a red team. The main difference is that focus lies on
                    transparency and collaboration between red, blue, engineering, and management teams.</p>
                <p>If attacks succeed and are not caught, detections are fixed and implemented, and attacks are run
                    again right away–until there is a measurable improvement.</p>

                <h2 id="Systems_engineering">Systems engineering</h2>

                <p>Systems engineering uses systems thinking principles to organize the design, integration, and
                    management of a complex system over its life cycle.</p>
                <h3 id="DevOps">DevOps</h3>
                <p>The DevOps pipeline is the heart of modern software development. It facilitates communication and
                    workflows between development and operations teams, allowing organizations to plan, develop, test,
                    and deploy applications quickly and accurately.</p>
                <p>DevOps automation tools allow teams to significantly enhance both the speed and reliability of
                    existing processes—and apply them globally for scalable growth. </p>
                <h3 id="Infrastructure_as_code">Infrastructure as code</h3>
                <p>No size fits all, but in general, configuration and management of infrastructures requires manually
                    provisioning physical and virtual servers, setting up IP addresses, subnets, routers, switches and
                    firewalls, installation of operating systems, and installation, configuration, updating of software,
                    like databases, web servers, and making backups, and recovering from disasters when needed.</p>
                <p>For disaster recovery it requires having some backup infrastructure on standby, and having clear
                    written procedures for if and when a component or the entire infrastructure goes down for whatever
                    reason. </p>
                <p>Once set up, Infrastructure as code (IaC) reduces the amount of manual work, the risk of errors,
                    and makes the infrastructure scalable, version-able, and repeatable. </p>
                <h3 id="headinclouds">Head in the clouds</h3>
                <p>Virtualisation technology in the cloud has become a huge resource to leverage, as it promises high
                    availability and access to resources from anywhere. From individuals, enterprises to large
                    conglomerates, nearly everyone is migrating towards the cloud. With this come
                    <b>often unseen threats</b> because cloud environments are different from the traditional
                    infrastructure.
                <h3 id="on-premises">On-premises IaC</h3>
                <p>With on-premises, the code will configure servers, network devices, storage and software located
                    on your premises. “Premises” can mean physical infrastructure in a premises owned by an
                    organisation or rented in a data centre like Hetzner. IaC tools like Ansible, Chef and Puppet
                    can be used (and others can be configured to do so) to manage and provision infrastructure on
                    physical servers or virtual machines. </p>
                <p>The main advantage of using <b>on-premises clouds</b> for IaC and code in general is that it allows
                    complete control. This complete control can be useful (understatement) for security and compliance
                    requirements that call for <b>data sovereignty</b>. </p>
