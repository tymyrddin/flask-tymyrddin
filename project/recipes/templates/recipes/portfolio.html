        <h2>Core offerings</h2>
        <p>I support tech teams and mission-led organisations with strategic security, scenario-driven facilitation, and grounded resilience-building. My work blends systems thinking with deep technical insight, favouring practical outcomes over theatre.</p>

        <h2>Focus areas</h2>

        <h3>Threat modelling & risk-driven architecture</h3>
        <p>I help teams think like attackers — then act like adults. Through collaborative modelling sessions, I support critical decisions around architecture, trade-offs, and defensive priorities. Minimal jargon. No AI panics. No Big Tech overkill.</p>

        <ul class="resource-links">
        <li><a href="https://broomstick.tymyrddin.dev/posts/on-prem-cloud/">Cloud-on-prem vs Big Tech</a>: The cloud isn’t just infrastructure—it’s a power structure. Choose yours with both eyes open.</li>
        <li><a href="https://broomstick.tymyrddin.dev/tags/ai/">No AI panics</a>: Some wyrd takes on AI</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Hands-on security labs & workshops</h3>
        <p>I design training that sticks. This includes role-based exercises, attack simulations, and decision drills that reveal blind spots and test assumptions. Sessions are always tailored — never off-the-shelf — and support teams at any stage.</p>

        <ul class="resource-links">
        <li><a href="https://purple.tymyrddin.dev/docs/transfer/">Raising security awareness</a>: Wisdom comes from experience. Experience is often a result of lack of wisdom.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Organisational resilience & facilitation</h3>
        <p>Using methods grounded in systems thinking and Satir-based development, I work with leadership to navigate complexity, improve decision-making, and sustain healthy, adaptable structures. This includes retrospectives, strategy support, and future-scenario planning.</p>

        </ul>

        <h3>Digital safety for grassroots and nonprofits</h3>
        <p>Security support should be accessible, not extractive. I build practical, long-term solutions for advocacy networks, shelters, and volunteer teams. This includes private SIEM setups, safer communication strategies, and support for projects like:</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>My work is grounded, iterative, and focused on what actually helps people make better security decisions. Whether the challenge is technical, organisational, or behavioural — I’ll help you ask sharper questions, design clearer responses, and avoid the usual hype.</p>
