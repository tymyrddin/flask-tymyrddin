        <h2>See around corners</h2>
        <p><em>Practical explorations to anticipate risks, behaviours, and emerging challenges.</em></p>

        <p><a href="https://green.tymyrddin.dev/">The Privacy Greenhouse</a> maps how personal data flows, leaks, and mutates in everyday tech. Rooted in slow thinking and participatory threat modelling, it helps individuals and organisations identify threats, understand attacker incentives, and cultivate privacy resilience in complex, shifting conditions.</p>

        <p><a href="https://red.tymyrddin.dev/">Red Wilds</a> examines attacker behaviours, tradecraft, and persistence. Using a digital forest metaphor, it explores lateral movement, privilege escalation, and deception, helping teams understand and disrupt adversary rhythms.</p>

        <p><a href="https://blue.tymyrddin.dev/">Blue Beacon</a> focuses on building trustworthy systems that maintain clarity, integrity, and resilience under pressure. Strategic defence, access control, audit-friendly logging, and actionable data flows go beyond compliance.</p>

        <h2>Learn by doing</h2>
        <p><em>Hands-on, practical experiences that generate insight and build operational capabilities.</em></p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://poweron.tymyrddin.dev/">PowerOn</a>: Workshops for shelters, survivors, and frontline teams. Combines attacker-aware threat modelling with self-hosted security infrastructure and guided exercises. Designed for non-technical participants. Currently under development; launch January 2026. <a href="https://github.com/ninabarzh/poweron">GitHub repository</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/ninabarzh/secure-shelter-siem-stack">Secure Shelter SIEM Stack (under construction, throw one away to ...)</a>: Hardened SIEM for shelters and crisis centres, with real-time monitoring, pre-configured dashboards, and TLS encryption. Minimal IT overhead. Launch January 2026</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/ninabarzh/pers">Pers â€“ Open sustainability search</a>: Open-source search engine for sustainability content, built on Typesense. Fast, relevant, user-friendly, deployed on Hetzner.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/ninabarzh/security-wazuh-monitor">Security detectors for Wazuh (playful first attempts)</a>: Modular monitoring solution integrating custom detectors into Wazuh via Docker. Use cases: training, development/testing, demonstrations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Move together</h2>
        <p><em>Collaborative projects that reveal dependencies, blind spots, and coordination strategies.</em></p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://purple.tymyrddin.dev/docs/choreographies/">Facilitated choreographies</a>: Adaptive exercises guide teams to anticipate challenges and move in sync. Repeated in workshops and incident simulations to ensure practical adoption.</li>
            <li>Incident response simulations embedded in PowerOn and Secure Shelter SIEM deployments allow teams to test procedures, communication, and continuity in realistic contexts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Build to last</h2>
        <p><em>Projects designed for resilience, maintainability, and extendable learning.</em></p>

        <ul>
            <li>Insights from Privacy Greenhouse, Red Wilds, and Blue Beacon can support sustainable practices for privacy, security, and operational clarity.</li>
            <li>PowerOn and Secure Shelter SIEM Stack can turn lessons into manuals, dashboards, and workflows that scale with teams.</li>
            <li>Open-source contributions like the Wazuh detectors express the need for reinforcing operational resilience while promoting collaborative development.</li>
        </ul>
