        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p><strong>Technically fluent. Organisationally aware. Occasionally paranoid—on purpose.</strong></p>

        <p>I’m Nienke Fokma (a.k.a. Nina Barzh), a digital security practitioner with over 40 years of experience in systems thinking, technical facilitation, and organisational resilience. I have worked as a systems architect, startup co-founder, and advisor to human rights groups, NGOs, and civic tech projects—from Silicon Valley to grassroots shelters.</p>
        <p>My work blends technical knowledge with a pragmatic sense of risk, culture, and communication. Whether threat modelling with a dev team, running red/blue exercises, or supporting communities building digital autonomy, I focus on what people actually need—not just what’s fashionable.</p>

        <h2>Why I do this</h2>

        <p>Security is never static. Tools evolve, threats adapt, and trust is constantly renegotiated. My goal is to help people make clearer, more confident decisions under pressure—without fearmongering, silver bullets, or jargon.</p>

        <h2>How I work</h2>

        <p>Collaboratively. Plainspoken. Lightweight by design. I work with the people doing the real work, helping them build systems they can understand, run, and repair—no black boxes, no nonsense.</p>
