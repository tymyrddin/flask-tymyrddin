        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p><em>Technically fluent. Organisationally aware. Occasionally paranoid, on purpose.</em></p>
        <p>I’m Nienke Fokma (a.k.a. Nina Barzh), a digital security practitioner with over 40 years of
            experience in systems thinking, technical facilitation, and organisational resilience. I've
            worked in telecommunications, startups, and with human rights groups.</p>

        <h2>Who this is for</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Security teams building detection and response capabilities, running exercises, developing cross-training programmes.</li>
        <li>Organisations preparing for ISO 27001 certification or NIS2 compliance who want genuine security improvement, not just paperwork.</li>
        <li>SOCs and SIRTs needing to test procedures, validate detection coverage, train analysts, and demonstrate capability.</li>
        <li>Leadership wanting honest assessment of security posture and practical roadmap for improvement.</li>
        <li>Anyone who suspects their security programme looks better on slides than it works in practice.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why organisations work with me</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>You need security that survives contact with reality. Compliance frameworks and best practices provide structure, but organisations also need people who can detect actual attacks, coordinate response across teams, and recover operations under pressure.</li>
        <li>You want to own your security programme. The security programme should be yours. You should understand it, operate it, and modify it without calling external experts every time something changes.</li>
        <li>You want teams that can handle incidents. Perfect prevention is impossible. Organisations that thrive are those that detect quickly, respond effectively, and learn from every incident.</li>
        <li>You need to meet compliance requirements meaningfully. ISO 27001 and NIS2 can build genuine capability to manage risk and respond to threats when implemented with operational focus.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What makes this different</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Hands-on facilitation, not just advice. Workshops where we build threat and risk models together. Exercises where teams practise incident response procedures. Training where people learn by doing, not watching slides.</li>
        <li>Building capability, not dependency. You own what we create. Playbooks you can modify. Detection rules you understand. Procedures your teams can follow without calling me.</li>
        <li>Learning from exercises, not just incidents. Simulations reveal detection gaps in safe environments. Tabletop exercises test response procedures before real crises. Cross-training builds versatile teams.</li>
        <li>Compliance that strengthens operations. ISO 27001 implementation that produces working ISMS, not just certification. NIS2 preparation that builds detection and response capabilities you'd want anyway.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>Start where you are. Don't wait for perfect conditions. Begin with simple exercises, build confidence, add complexity as capability grows.</p>
        <p>Work within constraints. Budget limits. Time pressures. Staffing shortages. Compliance deadlines. Security that ignores operational reality gets ignored. I work within your constraints to deliver value.</p>
        <p>Build what lasts. Train your people. Document your systems. Create capability that survives after I leave. Own your security programme.</p>
        <p>Learn from everything. Incidents teach lessons. Exercises reveal gaps. Mistakes in safe environments prevent mistakes when it matters. Continuous improvement beats perfect planning.</p>
        <p>Blameless learning. Most failures aren't malice or incompetence: they are under-resourced teams, competing priorities, or missing knowledge. Help people improve rather than shaming current state.</p>
