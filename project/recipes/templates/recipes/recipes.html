        <p>I'm Nienke Fokma — some know me as Nina Barzh — and I help people make sense of the digital mess we've all
            inherited.</p>

        <p>Security shouldn't feel like an elite club for hoodie-clad cryptographers. It should be understandable,
            usable, and above all, relevant. That’s why I work with NGOs, small businesses, and curious individuals
            who want more than just checklists — they want clarity. And maybe the odd firewall that doesn’t implode
            when someone blinks at it.</p>

        <p>Whether I’m unpacking how attackers actually think, untangling a phishing lure, or translating
            policy-speak into plain English, I do security as conversation — not sermon. No jargon unless it's
            ironic. No snake oil. Just practical threat modelling, low-budget resilience, and advice that assumes
            you’ve got more to do than memorise CVEs.</p>

        <p>My approach? Grounded. Informed. Not afraid to name the systemic flaws behind your inbox disasters.</p>

        <p>My goal? Replacing anxiety with agency — one plain-spoken, context-rich explanation at a time. Because
            in a world built on digital duct tape, your best defence isn’t more tech. It’s understanding what’s
            really going on behind the screen.</p>
