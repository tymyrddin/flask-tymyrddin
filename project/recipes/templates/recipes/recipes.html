        <p>I’m Nienke Fokma (sometimes known as Nina Barzh), and I help people cut through the noise of cybersecurity
            to focus on what really matters: clear risks, smart defences, and practical habits that last.</p>

        <p>Security shouldn’t be a black box or a barrier. It should be a conversation — one that empowers people,
            not overwhelms them. That’s why I work with NGOs, small teams, and mission-driven organisations to build
            digital resilience that fits the real world — not just the policy slide deck.</p>

        <p>Whether it’s demystifying how attackers operate, spotting social engineering in action, or translating
            technical controls into plain language, I bring deep expertise with a no-nonsense approach. The goal
            isn’t just compliance. It’s awareness that works.</p>

        <p>My approach? Patient, practical, and grounded in the realities of both human behaviour and digital
            threat landscapes.</p>

        <p>My goal? To shift security from checkbox to culture — one informed, confident user at a time.</p>
