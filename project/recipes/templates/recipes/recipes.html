<p>I’m Nienke Fokma (sometimes known as Nina Barzh). I help teams and organisations focus on what matters in
    cybersecurity: clear risks, practical defences, and habits that actually stick.</p>

<p>Security should be a conversation, not a barrier. I work with NGOs, founders, and small teams under
    pressure to build digital resilience that fits their reality—not just the policy deck.</p>

<p>Whether it is mapping threats, untangling governance knots, or keeping systems sane as they scale, I bring decades
    of hands-on experience and a strong bias for the practical. No magic boxes. No vendor theatre. Just awareness that works.</p>

<p>My approach is patient and pragmatic, grounded in the messy overlap between human behaviour and technical systems.</p>

<p>My goal? To make security normal. Embedded. Understandable. And strong enough to hold when things get rough.</p>
