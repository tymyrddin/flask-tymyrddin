        <p>Security shouldn’t feel like a secret language only tech wizards understand. I’m Nienke Fokma (though you
            might know me as Nina Barzh), and I break down digital protection into real, usable knowledge for NGOs,
            small businesses, and individuals who just want to get things done safely.</p>

        <p>I teach security that sticks – no corporate fluff, no unnecessary complexity. Whether
            it’s understanding how hackers actually think, learning to spot phishing attempts before they hook you,
            or finally making sense of those privacy settings that seem designed to confuse, I translate tech
            anxiety into clear action.</p>

        <p>My approach? Practical, patient, and perpetually curious. I believe good security should feel like a
            helpful conversation, not a lecture. When we work together, you won’t just get solutions – you’ll
            understand why they matter and how to maintain them.</p>

        <p>Let’s replace confusion with confidence, one step at a time. Because in a world full of (digital)
            smoke and mirrors, seeing clearly is the first step to staying safe.</p>
