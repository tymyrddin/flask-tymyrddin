<p>I’m Nienke Fokma (sometimes known as Nina Barzh). I help teams and organisations cut through the noise of cybersecurity to focus on what matters: clear risks, sensible defences, and habits that last.</p>

<p>Security should be a conversation, not a barrier. I work with NGOs, founders, and small teams under pressure to develop digital resilience that fits the real world — not just the policy deck or pitch narrative.</p>

<p>Whether it's mapping threats, untangling governance messes, or making sure security doesn’t vanish under scaling stress, I bring decades of hands-on experience and a bias for the practical. No magic boxes. No vendor drama. Just awareness that works.</p>

<p>My approach? Patient, pragmatic, and rooted in the realities of both human behaviour and technical systems at scale.</p>

<p>My goal? To make security normal — not perfect, not heroic, but embedded where it needs to be.</p>
