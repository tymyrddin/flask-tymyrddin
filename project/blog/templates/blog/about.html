              <h3>No instant transportation</h3>
              <p class="text-muted">Digital security is a fascinating field to work in; it is not the good guys vs bad guys, white hats vs gray hats vs black hats, or about computer science, math and teaching degrees (although I have them). Technical knowledge is important, but that is just logic.</p>
              <p>A love for puzzling, not being afraid of new experiences, a lifetime of learning, understanding what makes people tick, and <a href="../awareness">supporting others</a>, will give better results.</p>
          </div>

              <h3>Never Up To Date</h3>
              <p>People's devices, their data, and people themselves can be at risk. We need to prevent, find, and fix these vulnerabilities, before an attacker takes advantage.</p>
              <p class="text-muted">I do not assume I know it all, nor that which was valid yesterday, will be valid today.</p><p>I keep researching and learning, and can transfer the knowledge and skills I do keep and make sense in context, and bring positive attitudes to the table.</p>

              <h3>With Love</h3>
              <p class="text-muted">Working with threats and threat modelling requires a paranoia mindset. A higher paranoia level makes it harder for an attacker to go undetected. It all depends on the possible impact what level of paranoia is needed.</p>
              <p>This can be unhealthy for our minds. I use humour. Laughing brings oxygen to the brain, which reduces the effects of paranoia. On top of that, an oxygenated mind is more relaxed and has a much greater capacity for clear thinking.</p>

              <h3>Does not always work with your device</h3>
              <p>Large organisations and corporations can afford to use <a href="../teaming">colourful teaming</a>. Smaller organisations can perhaps not afford such costs at all, unless we get creative and find new forms which are just as effective, perhaps even more. </p>
              <p class="text-muted">The hardest part is finding a common ground to start from and an agreed-upon desired state to work towards.</p>
              <p>I offer low-budget support for not-for-profit organisations.</p>
